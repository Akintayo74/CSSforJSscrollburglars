        <p>
          It's been about 3 years since I quit my traditional
          in-office job and started working from a co-working space
          for a remote-friendly company. In that time I've gotten a
          lot of questions from folks about it, and the most common
          questions tend to focus on how to get started as a remote
          worker.
        </p>

        <p>Let's talk about how to find a remote gig.</p>

        <h2>Evaluating friendliness</h2>

        <p>
          It's very easy for companies to add "remote work" as a
          keyword to a job listing, but it's much harder for companies
          to create policies and culture that treat remote workers
          well.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first question I always ask when trying to evaluate an
          organization: what % of the company is remote?
        </p>
        <p>
          If the company only has one or two remote workers, it's
          almost a guarantee that all elements of the culture are
          biased for in-office workers. These kinds of arrangements
          can still work, but it's a much steeper hill to climb. By
          contrast, some organizations are fully distributed - they
          have no head office, every employee works from their own
          environment. Entire categories of problems evaporate with
          this kind of arrangement.
